                My name is Yugal Dhiman. I am 24 years old and I was born on 14 may 1999. in meerut.
                my journey has been shaped by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to personal growth.
                Born 1999, I have navigated life's diverse experiences with resilience and an insatiable curiosity. From
                a young age, I exhibited a love for book study, foreshadowing my lifelong affinity for coding.
                Throughout my academic years, I've honed my analytical skills and cultivated a deep appreciation for
                sports. Beyond the confines of the classroom, I've actively sought opportunities to contribute to my
                community through community service. These experiences have not only enriched my worldview but have also
                instilled in me a sense of responsibility to effect positive change. My journey is an ongoing narrative
                of growth, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to leaving a
                meaningful impact on the world.
